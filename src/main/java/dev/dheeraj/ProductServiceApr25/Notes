Calling 3rd Party APIs - 11-05-2025

1. Write the mechanism to call - getAllProduct and getProductById APIs on fakeStore.
2. Create our own APIs, to get all products and getProductById which will internally call fakeStore and show the data.

CLIENT <-> ProductService <-> FakeStoreAPI

controller -> contains the APIs
service -> contains the business logic
repository -> talks to DB, does CRUD
model -> contains schema
client -> classes that will talk to other service.



ProductService -->(will talk with) --> FakeStore Service
so we need a client name as
FakeStoreClient -> contains the code to communicate with FakeStore
